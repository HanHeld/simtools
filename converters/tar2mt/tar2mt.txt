tar2mt converts a tar file to a simh .tap tape image.

.tap format tape images have the format

	4 byte record length 1
	record 1
	repeat of 4 byte record length 1
	4 byte record length 2
	record 2
	repeat of 4 byte record length 2
	:
	4 bytes = 00000000 for end of file

and so on.  This is the tape format expected by simh, Tim Stark's TS10,
and John Wilson's E11.

tar2mt is invoked by

	tar2mt {-b blocksize} file1 file2 file3...

blocksize defaults to 8192.

Each file in turn is converted from a tar file to a .tap tape image.  The
input file can have any extension; the converted file will have a .tap
extension.
